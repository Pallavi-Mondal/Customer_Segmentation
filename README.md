Segmenting customers is the process of dividing the entire consumers set into groups with similar needs and wants. It can help companies to focus on marketing efforts, so that customer satisfaction and overall profit could be achieved at higher rates. Segmentation exists to mitigate the inevitable problems that evolve from a "One size fits all" approach. Best in class suppliers develops different types of segmentation to understand how to create, position, and communicate the value of their offering to address the different needs required in different customer segments.

Many companies adopts different segmentation schemes, that is often develop best but static (snapshot of consumer's preferences at the moment). Market trends evolve over time. It may grow, decline or disappear within certain time period due to number of reasons like demographics trend, technological advancement, economic cycles etc.


At some point, it becomes impossible to focus on an individual customer and sometimes the communication between customers become complex. We need a way out to understand our customers in structured and shared manner.
